# Genshin-Impact-Survey-Analysis
Genshin Impact is a Free to play game that was named the "Best Mobile Game" of 2021 at the Game Awards (TGA). However, although the game is free, there are features that are unlocked by paying for them with real currency. I thought it would be interesting to discover just how much people are spending on this "Free to play" game and some of the factors that may contribute to their spending. This project surveys 96 individuals about how much they have spent on Genshin Impact, how long they have played the game, their age, and their gender. The data was collected via Google forms and was processed as a dataframe and graph via python. 
I presented the survey to a discord group of people that play Genshin Impact. Despite having almost 100 survey forms, this is a small sample size of the population that plays Genshin Impact since it is a very popular game that boasts approximately 50 million players on a monthly basis. Another bias is that most of the people surveyed were in a similar age range and that women had a low representation in this data set. Another precaution to consider with this data is that I did not fact check or verify the authenticity of the results of the surveys.
